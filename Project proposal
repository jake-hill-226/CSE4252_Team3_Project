Project title: E-reader
Motivation: We like to read books. 
			Education on how to build an eReader.
			Interest in posibilities with Console based UIs

Features:
  - Console based interface
  - select book from personal library
  - read various formats (.PDF, .TXT, .DOC, .DOCX, Compiled HTML, etc.)
  - navigate to chapters
  - recall where you left off and make bookmarks
      data stored for each book opened
  - change font/size/color
  - notes in the margin

Work disribution:
  1 person, write UI interface described above
  1 person, import different file types (at least PDFs and word formats),
  			assist with middle logic and back-end if file conversion proves
  			easier than expected.
  1 person, write the middle logic that provides data to UI and logic to
  			back-end

*** For File Conversion ***
We intend to use external libraries or Linux shell scripts to help
in this process. Some scripts come standard with Linux (PDF converter),
others we intend to look into their feasability. At the least we will have
a plain-text reader, .PDF reader, and HTML interpreter.
